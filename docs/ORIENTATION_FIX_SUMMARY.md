# Orientation Preservation Fix - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of orientation preservation in the clothing swap feature, which prevents the system from incorrectly changing a person's viewing angle (e.g., changing from back-facing to front-facing).

## Problem Statement

**Critical Issue**: When performing clothing swap operations, if the original image showed a person from the back (back-facing), the output incorrectly showed them from the front (front-facing). This was strictly prohibited and needed to be fixed.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a **Hybrid Approach** combining:
1. **GPT-4o-mini-based orientation detection** - Automatically detects person's viewing angle
2. **Enhanced prompt engineering** - Explicitly instructs the model to preserve orientation
3. **Orientation-specific instructions** - Tailored guidance based on detected orientation

## Changes Made

### 1. New Method: `detect_person_orientation()` 

**File**: [`src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py`](../src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py)

**Location**: Lines 217-337

**Purpose**: Uses GPT-4o-mini API to analyze images and detect person orientation.

**Returns**:
```python
{
    "orientation": "front-facing" | "back-facing" | "left-profile" | "right-profile" | "three-quarter-left" | "three-quarter-right",
    "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
    "description": "detailed description of visible features"
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Analyzes face visibility, body position, and visible features
- Classifies into 6 distinct orientations
- Provides confidence level for reliability assessment
- Graceful fallback if GPT-4o-mini is unavailable

### 2. New Method: `_get_orientation_instruction()`

**File**: [`src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py`](../src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py)

**Location**: Lines 504-541

**Purpose**: Generates orientation-specific instruction text for prompts.

**Features**:
- Maps each orientation to explicit preservation instructions
- Adds extra emphasis for low-confidence detections
- Provides clear, unambiguous guidance to the model

**Example Output**:
```
For "back-facing":
"The person is facing AWAY (back view) with their back visible and face not shown. 
Maintain this BACK-FACING orientation exactly - do NOT turn them around to show their face."
```

### 3. Enhanced Method: `build_enhanced_flux_prompt()`

**File**: [`src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py`](../src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py)

**Changes**:
- Added parameters: `orientation` and `orientation_confidence`
- Integrates orientation-specific instructions into prompts
- Enhanced negative prompts to prevent orientation changes

**New Negative Prompt Additions**:
```
"changing viewing angle, rotating the person, showing front when back is shown, 
showing back when front is shown, perspective changes, orientation changes, 
turning the person around, flipping the view, reversing the direction"
```

### 4. Updated Method: `prepare()`

**File**: [`src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py`](../src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py)

**Changes**:
- Added orientation detection as Step 0 (before clothing analysis)
- Stores orientation info in analysis JSON
- Passes orientation to prompt builder
- Enhanced metadata storage

**Flow**:
```
1. Detect person orientation (NEW)
2. Analyze clothing details
3. Combine analysis data (NEW)
4. Build prompts with orientation (ENHANCED)
5. Generate masks
6. Create combined inputs
```

### 5. Enhanced Method: `_generate_flux_prompts_with_gpt()`

**File**: [`src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py`](../src/azure_bfl_compare/tasks/outfit_transfer.py)

**Changes**:
- Added `orientation` parameter
- Includes orientation context in GPT prompt generation
- Ensures GPT-generated prompts preserve viewing angle

### 6. Test Script: `test_orientation_detection.py`

**File**: [`scripts/test_orientation_detection.py`](../scripts/test_orientation_detection.py)

**Purpose**: Validates orientation detection functionality.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Test multiple sample images
python scripts/test_orientation_detection.py

# Test specific image
python scripts/test_orientation_detection.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

**Features**:
- Tests orientation detection on sample images
- Displays detection results with confidence
- Shows generated prompt instructions
- Provides summary of all results

## Technical Details

### Orientation Detection Process

1. **Image Analysis**: Sends image to GPT-4o-mini with structured prompt
2. **Feature Identification**: Analyzes face visibility, chest/torso, back visibility
3. **Classification**: Categorizes into one of 6 orientations
4. **Confidence Rating**: Assesses detection certainty
5. **Validation**: Normalizes output to valid orientation values

### Prompt Enhancement Strategy

**Before** (Generic):
```
"matching the subject's pose and perspective in the upper panel"
```

**After** (Specific for back-facing):
```
"The person is facing AWAY (back view) with their back visible and face not shown. 
Maintain this BACK-FACING orientation exactly - do NOT turn them around to show their face."
```

### Metadata Storage

New fields in `analysis.json`:
```json
{
  "clothing": {
    "clothing_type": "upper_cloth",
    "description": "...",
    "fine_details": "...",
    "style": "casual"
  },
  "orientation": {
    "orientation": "back-facing",
    "confidence": "high",
    "description": "Person's back is visible..."
  }
}
```

## Benefits

```python
orientation_info = {"orientation": None, "confidence": None, "description": ""}
```

2. **Partial Rollback**: Keep enhanced prompts but skip detection:
```python
# Comment out in prepare()
# orientation_info = self.detect_person_orientation(original_image)
orientation_info = {"orientation": None, "confidence": None, "description": ""}
```

3. **Full Rollback**: The enhanced prompts alone (Quick Win) still provide significant improvement even without detection.

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "GPT orientation detection failed"
- **Cause**: Azure GPT credentials missing or network issue
- **Solution**: Check `.env` file for correct credentials, or detection will fall back to generic instructions

**Issue**: Low confidence detections
- **Cause**: Unusual pose, poor image quality, or partial occlusion
- **Solution**: System adds extra emphasis; manual review recommended

**Issue**: Incorrect orientation detected
- **Cause**: Ambiguous pose or unusual angle
- **Solution**: Check `analysis.json` for details; may need manual override feature

### Debug Steps

1. Check console output for orientation detection results
2. Review `analysis.json` for stored orientation data
3. Run test script: `python scripts/test_orientation_detection.py --image <path>`
4. Verify prompts include orientation instructions
5. Check metadata for orientation preservation confirmation

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, reliable solution to the critical orientation preservation problem. The hybrid approach combines automated detection with explicit prompt engineering to ensure that people maintain their original viewing angle during clothing swap operations.

**Key Achievement**: Back-facing people stay back-facing, front-facing people stay front-facing, and all orientations are preserved correctly.
