# Solutions for Preserving Person Orientation in Clothing Swap

## Problem Statement
When performing clothing swap operations, if the original image shows a person from the back (back-facing), the output incorrectly shows them from the front (front-facing). This is a critical issue that must be prevented.

## Approach 1: GPT-4o-mini Orientation Detection (Recommended)

### Description
Use GPT-4o-mini API to analyze the original image and detect the person's orientation, then explicitly include this in the prompt.

### Advantages
- ✅ Most accurate - leverages advanced vision model
- ✅ Can detect subtle orientation cues (head position, shoulder angle, etc.)
- ✅ Natural language output integrates well with existing prompt system
- ✅ Can detect multiple orientations (front, back, left profile, right profile, 3/4 view)
- ✅ Already using GPT-4o-mini for clothing analysis, so no new dependencies

### Disadvantages
- ⚠️ Adds one additional API call per task
- ⚠️ Small latency increase (~1-2 seconds)
- ⚠️ Depends on Azure GPT endpoint availability

### Implementation
```python
def detect_person_orientation(self, image_path: str) -> str:
    """Detect whether person is facing front, back, or profile."""
    # Analyze image with GPT-4o-mini
    # Returns: "front-facing", "back-facing", "left-profile", "right-profile", "three-quarter-left", "three-quarter-right"
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Risk**: Low

## Approach 2: Computer Vision-Based Detection

### Description
Use OpenCV/MediaPipe pose estimation to detect body keypoints and determine orientation based on visible features.

### Advantages
- ✅ Fast and local (no API calls)
- ✅ Deterministic results
- ✅ No additional costs

### Disadvantages
- ❌ Requires additional dependencies (MediaPipe or OpenPose)
- ❌ Less accurate with partial views or occluded bodies
- ❌ May fail with unusual poses or clothing
- ❌ Harder to distinguish subtle orientations
- ❌ More complex implementation

### Implementation
```python
def detect_orientation_cv(self, image_path: str) -> str:
    """Use pose estimation to detect orientation."""
    # Use MediaPipe/OpenPose to get keypoints
    # Calculate nose-to-shoulder vector
    # Determine orientation from visible keypoints
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 1-2 days
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Risk**: Medium (accuracy concerns)

---

## Approach 3: Dual-Prompt Strategy

### Description
Instead of detecting orientation, use a prompt that explicitly preserves ALL aspects of the original pose and viewing angle.

### Advantages
- ✅ No detection needed
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Works for all orientations automatically

### Disadvantages
- ❌ Less explicit control
- ❌ Model might still misinterpret without specific orientation guidance
- ❌ Relies on model's interpretation of "preserve viewing angle"

### Implementation
```python
prompt = (
    f"Replace the {clothing_region} with the EXACT clothing shown in the reference panel. "
    f"CRITICAL: Maintain the EXACT viewing angle and orientation of the person - "
    f"if they are shown from behind, keep them from behind; if from the front, keep them from the front. "
    f"The person's body orientation, pose, and viewing angle must remain ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL. "
    # ... rest of prompt
)

negative_prompt = (
    # ... existing negative prompt
    "changing viewing angle, rotating the person, front view when should be back view, "
    "back view when should be front view, altered orientation, perspective changes, "
)
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 30 minutes
- **Complexity**: Very Low
- **Risk**: Medium (depends on model understanding)

## Approach 4: Orientation Metadata from User Input

### Description
Require users to specify the orientation when submitting the task.

### Advantages
- ✅ 100% accurate
- ✅ No detection needed
- ✅ Simple implementation

### Disadvantages
- ❌ Requires user to provide additional input
- ❌ Breaks automation for batch processing
- ❌ User error possibility

### Implementation
```python
# In task configuration
{
    "outfit": {
        "orientation": "back-facing",  # Required field
        # ... other fields
    }
}
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 1 hour
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Risk**: Low (technical), High (UX friction)

---

## Approach 5: Hybrid Approach (Detection + Explicit Prompting)

### Description
Combine GPT-4o-mini detection with enhanced prompt engineering for maximum reliability.

### Advantages
- ✅ Most robust solution
- ✅ Explicit orientation instruction in prompt
- ✅ Fallback to general preservation if detection fails
- ✅ Can validate detection result

### Disadvantages
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex
- ⚠️ One additional API call

### Implementation Steps
1. Detect orientation using GPT-4o-mini
2. Include detected orientation explicitly in prompt
3. Add orientation-specific negative prompts
4. Store orientation in analysis metadata for debugging

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 3-4 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk**: Very Low

---

## Approach 6: Reference Image Orientation Analysis

### Description
Analyze both the original image AND the clothing reference image orientations, and ensure they match.

### Advantages
- ✅ Detects mismatched orientations
- ✅ Can warn user about incompatible combinations
- ✅ Most comprehensive solution

### Disadvantages
- ❌ Most complex
- ❌ May reject valid use cases (e.g., intentional orientation change)
- ❌ Two detection operations needed

### Implementation
```python
def validate_orientation_compatibility(
    self, 
    original_image: str, 
    clothing_image: str
) -> tuple[str, str, bool]:
    """Check if orientations are compatible."""
    orig_orientation = self.detect_person_orientation(original_image)
    cloth_orientation = self.detect_person_orientation(clothing_image)
    compatible = orig_orientation == cloth_orientation
    return orig_orientation, cloth_orientation, compatible
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 4-5 hours
- **Complexity**: High
- **Risk**: Low

## Recommended Solution: Hybrid Approach (Approach 5)

### Why This is Best
1. **Accuracy**: GPT-4o-mini provides reliable orientation detection
2. **Explicit Control**: Direct orientation instruction in prompts
3. **Robustness**: Works even if detection has minor errors
4. **Debuggability**: Stores orientation in metadata
5. **Cost-Effective**: Only one extra API call
6. **Maintainable**: Clean integration with existing code

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Add Orientation Detection (1 hour)
```python
def detect_person_orientation(self, image_path: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Detect person's orientation using GPT-4o-mini.
    
    Returns:
        {
            "orientation": "front-facing" | "back-facing" | "left-profile" | "right-profile" | "three-quarter",
            "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
            "description": "detailed description of what's visible"
        }
    """
```

#### Phase 2: Enhance Prompt Building (1 hour)
```python
def build_enhanced_flux_prompt(
    self,
    clothing_description: str,
    fine_details: str,
    clothing_type: str,
    orientation: str,  # NEW parameter
) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """Build prompt with explicit orientation preservation."""
    
    orientation_instruction = self._get_orientation_instruction(orientation)
    # Add to prompt...
```

#### Phase 3: Update Pipeline (1 hour)
```python
def prepare(self, ...) -> OutfitPreparationResult:
    # Detect orientation
    orientation_info = self.detect_person_orientation(original_image)
    
    # Include in analysis
    clothing_info = self.detect_clothing_type_enhanced(clothes_image)
    
    # Pass to prompt builder
    prompt, negative_prompt = self.build_enhanced_flux_prompt(
        clothing_info["description"],
        clothing_info["fine_details"],
        clothing_info["clothing_type"],
        orientation_info["orientation"],  # NEW
    )
```

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)
- Test with front-facing images
- Test with back-facing images
- Test with profile images
- Verify metadata storage

## Quick Win: Immediate Improvement (Approach 3)

While implementing the full solution, you can get immediate improvement by updating the prompt:

```python
# In build_enhanced_flux_prompt(), line ~415
prompt = (
    f"Replace the {clothing_region} worn by the person in the UPPER panel with the EXACT clothing "
    f"described below and demonstrated in the LOWER reference panel. "
    f"**CRITICAL ORIENTATION REQUIREMENT: The person's viewing angle and body orientation must remain "
    f"EXACTLY as shown in the upper panel. If the person is facing away (back view), keep them facing away. "
    f"If facing forward (front view), keep them facing forward. Do NOT rotate or change the viewing perspective.** "
    f"MAIN DESCRIPTION: {clothing_description}. "
    # ... rest of prompt
)

negative_prompt = (
    "blurry details, missing patterns, simplified textures, lost embellishments, generic fabric, "
    "inaccurate colors, smudged decorations, unclear trims, distorted patterns, faded prints, "
    "missing lace, lost embroidery, oversimplified design, low resolution, compression artifacts, "
    "distorted body, altered body proportions, altered pose, face changes, new makeup, changed "
    "expression, hair changes, skin tone changes, added or removed accessories, background "
    "alterations, editing the lower reference panel, duplicating extra people, altering body shape "
    "or identity, "
    "**changing viewing angle, rotating the person, showing front when back is shown, showing back when front is shown, "
    "perspective changes, orientation changes, turning the person around**"  # NEW
)
```

This takes **5 minutes** to implement and may provide **50-70% improvement** immediately while you work on the full solution.
